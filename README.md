Scripts and data associated with the manuscript: Transformer-based Prediction of Microbial Growth Rates from Genomic Data

## Overview

The code implements a transformer-based model for predicting the minimum doubling time of microbial genomes directly from genomic sequences. This includes:

- Preprocessing genomic FASTA files
- Tokenizing and embedding sequences
- Training and evaluating the finetuned model
- Incorporating metadata (e.g., growth temperature)
